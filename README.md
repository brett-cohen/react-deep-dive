# TypeScript and Type Checking
It's worth calling out that React is compatible with TypeScript, which allows for powerful type checking on
your components. Instead of `.jsx`, files will have the `.tsx` extension. 

As for implementation, we can define a `PropTypes` object for type checking the props our component will be
receiving.

See `typeChecking.tsx`.
