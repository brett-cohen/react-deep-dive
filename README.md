# react-deep-dive

This repo is a collection of explanations and code samples for the most important concepts of React. 
I recommend [the official React docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) if interested in learning further.

## Goals

1. Introduce you to the key ideas of React for further learning
2. Teach you enough to be dangerous

Once you've got the gist of things, [try building your own React app](https://create-react-app.dev/).
