# JSX

JSX a syntax extension for JavaScript. It is short for JavaScript XML, as it allows for XML-like code to be written in JavaScript.
Although not strictly required, JSX is frequently used with React to provide better syntax for creating UIs within JavaScript.

JSX is frequently compiled using [Babel](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/). Babel uses syntax transformers to convert JSX 
(as well as other Syntax enhancers) into backwards compatible JavaScript, so that you can develop React for a wide variety of environments.

I recommend the [React doc page for JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html) to go over more of the details, rather than me rehashing them here.
